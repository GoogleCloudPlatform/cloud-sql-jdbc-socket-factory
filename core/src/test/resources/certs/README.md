# Keys and Certificates for Testing 

**Generated Files, Don't Edit Directly!**

All the keys and certificate files in this folder are generated by the
script `core/src/test/resources/update_test_certs.sh`. If you need to add or
change the certificates used by the tests:

1. Modify `core/src/test/resources/update_test_certs.sh` to generate the
   certificates and keys needed by the new tests.
2. Generate the new certs and keys by running the `update_test_certs.sh` script.
   This will modify the files in `core/src/test/resources/certs`.
3. Modify `core/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/sql/core/TestKeys.java` with
   accessor methods to load the new certs and keys.
4. Commit all changes, including the generated files
   in `core/src/test/resources/certs`.
